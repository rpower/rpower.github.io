    "body": "Following World War II, a series of rules was established that all participating cars must conform to. These rules are called the formula. In 1946, Formula One was the introduced after World War II and the Turin Grand Prix, the first non-championship race was held later that same year. It wasn’t until 1950 when the first world championship race was held at Silverstone in the UK. Silverstone continues to hold the British Grand Prix in modern-day Formula 1. In 1958, the constructors championship was introduced. At Silverstone, Italian driver Giuseppe Farina won the first world championship race in his Alfa Romeo. Farina would go on to win the first Drivers’ World Championship ahead of his Alfa Romeo teammate, Juan Manuel Fangio. The following year in 1951, Fangio would go on to win the second Drivers’ World Championship and then four more in 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957. With 5 World Championships, Fangio still has the joint-second most championships alongside Lewis Hamilton and behind Michael Schumacher, who won 7 championships. The 50s were a tumultuous time for Formula One, in the 1952 and 1953 seasons, the championship were held to Formula Two regulations due to the lack of teams entering as a result of rising costs. The oldest team is Ferrari as they are the only team still-competing to have competed in the debut 1950 season. From the late-50s and early-60s, teams began to make technological improvements to the cars they entered. Starting with Mike Hawthorn’s championship win in 1958, British drivers went on to win 9 Drivers’ World Championships between them, and British teams went on to win 10 Constructors’ World Championships between 1962 and 1973. Formula One drivers continued to put their lives at risk competing and British driver Jackie Stewart retired ahead of the final race of the 1973 World Championship following the death of fellow team mate Francois Cevert. Two years later, Emerson Fittipaldi refused to compete in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix which stopped when a car crashed and killed five spectators. Jackie Stewart would go on to become a fervent advocate for increased safety within the sport:  “If I have any legacy to leave the sport I hope it will be seen to be an area of safety because when I arrived in Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical. ” In the 90s, McLaren and Williams were the two dominant constructors. McLaren won 9 Drivers’ Championships and 7 Constructors’ Championships in that time with their drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Senna and Prost had a close and intense rivalry until 1993 when Prost retired. The following year, Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing. That same weekend Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger also died following an accident during the qualifying session on the Saturday. Further rule changes were introduced with a focus on safety by the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile), Formula 1’s governing body. Between 1984 and 2008, four teams, out of those who competed, Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Renault went on to win every World Championship. The increasing cost of competing in Formula One a gap between the top teams and everyone else began to emerge. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher dominated the late-90s winning 6 consecutive Drivers’ World Championships between 1999 and 2004 (in addition to 5 consecutive Constructors’ World Championships for Ferrari during the same time). Since then, rules and regulations for Formula 1 entrants continued to evolve to encourage more competitive races and improve safety on-track. Formula 1 continued to expand worldwide and in 2020 will compete in 22 different countries around the world. "

    "title": "Pit Stops",
    "body": "Pit stops occur when a car returns to the ‘pit lane’, which is runs parallel to the start-finish straight. In each race, every car is obliged to make at least one pit stop. During each pit stop, the driver waits in the vehicle and up to 20 mechanics (known as the ‘pit crew’) make various repairs and modifications to the car. The Formula 1 regulations stipulate that in each race, every car must use two of the three ‘compounds’ of tyres. They therefore must make at least pit stop to change from one compound to another. These different tyre compounds have different coloured markings on the side of the tyre for spectators to differentiate between them. During a ‘wet race’, these rules are relaxed as drivers are no longer obliged to race using two different type compounds. Instead they race using either the ‘full wet’ tyres, during the rain, or the ‘intermediate’ tyres, during changeable conditions. Incidents and accidents during the race may require a team to make repairs to a car mid-race. For example, the front wing of the car may have to be replaced if it’s damaged. In the past, teams were also able to refuel their cars during a pit stop, however 2009 was the last season where this was an option to teams. One pit crew can only perform a pit stop on one car at a time, so teams must be careful to time the pit stops for their two drivers such that they do not clash. Sometimes teams will have their second car queue behind the first and perform two pit stops back to back. However this is a risky strategy because it puts pressure on the pit crews and introduces room for error. This is called ‘double stacking’ their pit stops. Another strategy teams will employ when battling one of their rival teams is to bring one of their drivers in to replace their old, worn tyres with new tyres. Their driver, on better tyres than their rivals, aims to then gain on their rivals so that when their rivals make their pit stop, they end up behind them. This is called the ‘undercut’. Pit crew mechanics can change a tyre in seconds, however making a pit stop is not an easy decision. This is because cars must drive through the pit lane at reduced speeds for safety reasons. This means that a pit stop can take at least 20-30 seconds depending on the track. As a result, when to make a pit stop is an important strategic decision a team must make. The position of rivals, position of their teammate, weather conditions, any damage to the car, tyre wear and other factors are all considerations to take into account when decide when to pit their drivers.

    "body": "Each race weekend, which is also known as a Grand Prix, teams, along with their two drivers, aim to earn as many championship points as possible. At the end of the season, the team with the most points from their drivers will be awarded the Constructors Championship and the individual driver with the most points will earn the Drivers Championship. Lewis Hamilton is the reigning Drivers Champion, and the team he races for, Mercedes, are the reigning Constructors Championship. The Formula 1 season is competed across 21 races around the world, so a team (and their drivers) will have to perform as well as they can, as consistently as they can, for almost 10 months across these 21 races to earn as many points as they can in each Grand Prix to maximise their chances of winning the Championship. Each Grand Prix takes place over a weekend with the following schedule:  Two practice sessions on a Friday One practice session followed by a Qualifying session on a Saturday The race is on a SundayThe practice sessions are used by teams to understand how their cars (and their drivers) are performing on a particular track. The teams have the opportunity to make a certain (limited) number of changes to their car throughout the weekend. The Qualifying session, which lasts around 90 minutes, is used to determine which order (or ‘position’) the cars will start the race on Sunday in. In the Qualifying session, drivers will attempt to set the fastest lap they can. Those who set the fastest lap earn a higher position on the starting grid with each driver aiming to make it as close as possible to the number 1 position (also known as ‘pole position’ or ‘pole’). This session is split into 3 parts (named ‘Q1’, ‘Q2’ and ‘Q3’) where in each session, the slowest 5 drivers will be knocked out (with their position determined by what order they finish at the end of each Qualifying session). In Q1, 20 drivers are reduced to 15 drivers, and in Q2 15 drivers are whittled down to 10 drivers. In the final session, Q3, the top 10 fastest drivers compete for the front 10 positions on the starting grid. Having a better position on the starting grid can confer a large advantage because drivers will make it as difficult as possible for competitors to overtake them. The race on Sunday is the most important part of the weekend, as no Championship points are awarded in any session outside of the race. Drivers line up on the starting grid in the order they qualified in (however on occasion, teams or drivers will incur penalties which may demote them to a lower grid position) and then when the race begins they will compete to complete a set number of laps (which varies depending on the track) as quickly as they can. The race usually lasts around 2 hours baring an incidents which temporarily stop the race midway. During the race, each driver is obligated to make a ‘pit-stop’ and change the type of tyres they have on their car. A pit-stop involves driving to a special area of the track (also known as the ‘pit-lane’) where their team’s mechanics will meet them and change their tyres as quickly as possible (on occasion the mechanics will be required to make other limited changes to the car, for example if part of the car is damaged, however this is also very costly in terms of time). Each team will try to make pit-stops as quickly as possible because each second counts. Making a pit-stop can cost a driver up to 30 seconds (because the drivers are obligated to drive slowly through the pit-lane in the name of safety) and the time it takes to actually change the tyre takes time. The record for the fastest tyre change is 1. 9 seconds. This introduces a level of strategy into the race because although teams have to make a pit-stop, when they make their pit-stop is at their discretion. Teams will try to optimise their strategy by choosing to make a pit-stop at the most opportune time. Factors such as the weather, damage to the car and other teams’ strategies will affect their decision. Drivers (and the teams they drive for) who finish in the top 10 will earn points (with more points being awarded to those who finish higher). Teams then repeat this for the 21 Grand Prix on the Formula 1 calendar. "

    "body": "2018/06/12 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

    "body": "2018/05/12 - gem install bundler installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

    "body": "2018/01/11 - Director Roland Suso Richter’s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney’s own play “Point of Death” - a title that gave away the film’s entire plot twist premise. As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: “When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?” The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”). Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside. ” (The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film’s ending. ) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!). A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there’s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is. So how do we do spoilers?: 1&lt;span class= spoiler &gt;My hidden paragraph here. &lt;/span&gt;"
